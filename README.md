# Developer-Site-with-FlexBox
It's a simple responsive Web design with flexBox.
Flexboxes are new codes in CSS that have been provided by the W3C to solve the problems of using float codes and the beautiful and more accurate design of sites, especially responsive sites. After the obsolescence of using tables in site template design, the use of float code was one of the most popular codes for designers, which caused problems for designers.
In addition to the fact that the use of Flexboxes is more basic than Float code, its use has a significant impact on the index of the site pages by Google search engines and as a result is very effective in SEO.
