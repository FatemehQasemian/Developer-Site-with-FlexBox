# Developer-Site-with-FlexBox
It's a simple responsive Web design with Flexbox.
The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.
In addition to the fact that the use of Flexboxes is more basic than Float code, its use has a significant impact on the index of the site pages by Google search engines and as a result is very effective in SEO.
